company: Railstars

One of my projects designed and built for an external client. This product was a small WiFi-enabled microcontroller that could be installed directly into a model train, permitting control of a train directly from a smartphone or other WiFi-capable device. This product was designed for use in newer-style layouts that do not power the trains from the rails.
