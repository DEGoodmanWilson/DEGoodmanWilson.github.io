Arduino clones designed to make it quick and easy to prototype [Layout Command Control](http://openlcb.org/openlcb-and-lcc-documents/layout-command-control-lcc/) nodes. Both products are built on the Atmel AT90CAN128 microcontroller. Io:duino uses the standard Arduino formfactor, and adds support for the CAN bus physical layer that LCC is built upon. Io discards the Arduino formfactor in favor of an interface readily wired into existing model train layouts.
