[Digital Command Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control) is a protocol for multiplexing a digital control signal with power, enabling the digital control of model trains using only the two conductive rails that the train physically sits upon. RAILbooster is a product that takes a low-power digital signal from a device (such as an Arduino running [CmdrArduino](https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino)), and injects power at 12â€“18V and 3A, thus conditioning the control signal for use over the rails and making it suitable for both power and control.
