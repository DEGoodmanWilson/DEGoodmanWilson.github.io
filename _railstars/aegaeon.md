Aegaeon is hardware and firmware for a computer that fits inside even very small model trains. In only 8K of highly
optimized C code, the Aegaeon firmware provides addressable control of a train's movement with realistic physical
simulation, as well as a range of special effects for the train's lighting.

The hardware design, although incomplete, is a fingernail-sized 4-layer board with robust motor and lighting controls
designed around the Atmel ATtiny84A microcontroller. (Why yes, I _can_ hand-solder 0201 components :wink: )
