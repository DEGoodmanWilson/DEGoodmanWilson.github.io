Aegaeon is hardware and firmware for a [Digital Command Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control) decoder that fits inside even very small model trains. In only 8K of highly optimized C code, the Aegaeon firmware provides addressable control of a train's movement with realistic physical simulation, as well as a range of special effects for the train's lighting.

The hardware design, although incomplete, is a fingernail-sized 4-layer PCB with robust motor and lighting controls designed around the Atmel ATtiny84A microcontroller, and intended to be installed into very small model trains.01 components :wink: )
