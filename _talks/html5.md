A conversational revolution is upon us. More and more services, from Lyft to Skype, are providing a conversational user
interface, and using messaging apps as their distribution channels and runtime. In this talk, I demonstrated to web
developers you how to expose your service as a conversation, demoed a few cool examples, and talked about the
Slack platform and the Slack fund. Q&A can be viewed seperately [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZfEQRy5N9U).
