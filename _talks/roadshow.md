Slack took to the road in the Spring of 2016 to celebrate both the work we’ve done so far and our best ideas to move
forward with the Amazing Teams Tour—an afternoon of talks and inspiration for using and building with Slack. At the
San Francisco, Toronto, and London stops, I gave the technical keynote, providing an overview of the Slack Platform
and live demonstrations showing how easy it is to get started developing Slack Apps.
