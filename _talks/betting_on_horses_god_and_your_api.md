Early stage startups often justify not investing in security because the likelihood of getting hacked is so ridiculously low that the risk can be safely ignored.  

I think this is a terrible argument. I want to convince you that security is an existential concern for your startup. 
I will use philosophy to convince you that I am right. And then I will use philosophy to justify talking about a new super-secret product we are working on at Sqreen that can help protect your APIs, webapps, and other lovely things that run over HTTP. And, if we have time, we might do a little analytical intuition-polling, and some decision theory too. What the hell.
