Collaborative screensharing places some interesting and unusual constraints on live streaming videoâ€”minimizing
latency while maintaining legibility of on-screen text means that buffering video is a non-starter. In
this talk, with Faraz Khan, I walk you through these constraints, and some of Screenhero's engineering solutions
including our no-buffering approach to rendering streaming video.
