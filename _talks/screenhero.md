Collaborative screensharing places some interesting and unusual constraints on live streaming video. Minimizing latency while maintaining legibility of on-screen text means that buffering video is a non-starter. In this talk with Faraz Khan I walk you through these constraints and explain some of Screenhero's engineering solutions including our no-buffering approach to rendering streaming video.
