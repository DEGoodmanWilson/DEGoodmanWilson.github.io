Slack messages have many formatting options—this tool makes it easy to preview these options, and make your bot or app’s messages look just so. I was the tech lead on this project, and in addition to implementing the product’s backend, I was responsible for technical decision making and ensuring that the project stayed in-scope and on-schedule.
