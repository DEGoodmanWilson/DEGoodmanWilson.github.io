One strategic focus of the Slack Platform is to be your company’s default identity provider. This product is a first step in that direction by allowing third parties to authenticate users with Slack to log them in. I was the tech lead on this project, and in addition to implementing the product’s backend, I was responsible for architecting the solution, technical decision making, and ensuring that the project stayed in-scope and on-schedule.
