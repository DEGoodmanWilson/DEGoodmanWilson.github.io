In the course of building libslack (see above), I contributed significantly to the [djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) project by adding [support for C++/Cx bindings](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni/pull/290) to enable building .NET assemblies for use on Windows Phone. (At the moment, my pull request is still under review).
