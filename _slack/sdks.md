The official SDKs—Slack Developer Kits—are the best way to get started building on the Slack Platform, whether you are looking to integrate Slack into your existing back office, or build the next great business bot. My team is responsible for documenting and maintaining these tools, as well as promoting these tools to Slack developers.
