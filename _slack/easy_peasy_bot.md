I authored this set of boilerplate code and documentation that make getting started building Slack-powered chatbots simple. The boilerplate code is built on top of BotKit, a Node.js module for building bots, and is designed to flexibly account for various deployment needs and use cases. The documentation is available online, and was previously available in printed form as a booklet that Slack would hand out at Platform events.
