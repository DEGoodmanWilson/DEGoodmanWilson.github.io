A Mac menubar utility to help you remember to lock your Mac. Deadbolt automatically locks your Mac when you remove a USB device of your choosing such as an iPhone or Yubikey, or you can set a global keyboard shortcut. Deadbolt leverages existing habits (taking your phone with you) to help you remember to keep your machine locked when you step away. Authored in Objective-C.
