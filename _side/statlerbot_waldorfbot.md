Invite Statler and Walfdorf, the lovable hecklers from the Muppet Show, to your Slack team. These conceptually simple bots engage each other in dialog to make fun of your posts in Slack. Built with Luna and Engine in modern C++, these bots demonstrate how complex bot behavior can arise from very simple stimulus-response pairings. They also serve as the starting point in an ongoing experiment in bot-to-bot communication.
