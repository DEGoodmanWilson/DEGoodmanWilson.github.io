An API that allowed third parties to initiate screen sharing sessions, it was effectively a remote control for the desktop appâ€™s UI. I was entirely responsible for the architecture, design, and implementation, including API security and the necessary modifications to our desktop clients. The backend was implemented in a delightful stack including Ruby/Grape and Erlang/ejabberd, which communicated using XMLRPC with the desktop clients.
