Screenhero provided an account management webapp that allowed users to set up paid subscriptions to the Screenhero service, pay for other usersâ€™ subscriptions, view invoices, and otherwise configure their Screenhero profile. I was entirely responsible for the technical architecture and engineering work, and worked closely with the design team on the visual design and UX. I chose to build the backend in Ruby with a combination of Sinatra and Grape, and the frontend as a single page app using Ractive.js.
