As my first task as Screenhero, I refactored the keyboard and mouse drivers. At a very low level, Screenhero modifies, and in some cases completely overrides, the USB input system on Mac. I refactored our drivers to support international keyboards, and the mouse drivers to accurately reflect the userâ€™s designated acceleration curves so that virtual input devices driven by remote users looked and behaved just like locally attached input devices.
